# Flood Prediction System Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the probability of flooding. Using a dataset with various features, the system trains a Random Forest Regressor model to estimate flood probabilities. The goal is to provide early warnings and support decision-making processes related to flood management.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flood-prediction-system.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**:

   ```bash
   cd flood-prediction-system

3. **Install the required packages:**:

   Ensure you have Python and pip installed. Then, install the necessary libraries using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
  Ensure requirements.txt includes dependencies such as pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.


## Usage

1. Prepare Your Data: Ensure your dataset is formatted correctly. The code assumes a DataFrame A with features and a target column FloodProbability.

2. Run the Script:

   You can run the Python script with:

   ```bash
   python flood_prediction.py

   This script performs the following steps:

  Loads and prepares the data.
  Splits the data into training and testing sets.
  Scales the features.
  Trains a Random Forest Regressor model.
  Makes predictions and evaluates the model.
  
3. Evaluate the Model:

After running the script, the model's performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error and R^2 Score will be available. The results can be visualized using the generated plots.

### Additional Tips

- **Ensure Requirements**: If you donâ€™t have a `requirements.txt` file yet, you can create one with the following command:

   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
